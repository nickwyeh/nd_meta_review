## Systematic Review and three level meta analysis .
#### What did i do?
* A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize the existing literature on how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to modulate episodic memory. Given the numerous parameters of TMS protocols and experimental design characteristics that can be manipulated, a mechanistic understanding of how changes in the combination of parameters (e.g., frequency, timing, intensity, targeted brain region, memory task) modulate episodic memory is needed. I reviewed 59 studies and conducted a meta-analysis on 245 effect sizes from 37 articles on healthy younger adults (N = 1,061). 
##### Main findings:
* Analyses revealed generally more beneficial effects of 1-Hz rTMS vs. other frequencies on episodic memory. Moderation analyses revealed complex interactions as online 20-Hz rTMS protocols led to negative effects, while offline 20-Hz rTMS led to enhancing effects. There was also an interaction between stimulation intensity and frequency as 20-Hz rTMS had more negative effects when applied below- vs. at-motor threshold. Conversely, 1-Hz rTMS had more beneficial effects than other frequencies when applied below- vs. at- or above-motor threshold.

* The three level meta analysis was carried out in R with the [metafor package](https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php). For additional details on implementing a three level meta analysis in R see [Assink, M., & Wibbelink, C. J. (2016)](https://www.tqmp.org/RegularArticles/vol12-3/p154/p154.pdf)
